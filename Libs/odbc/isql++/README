README for isql++					(1999-03-31)

This is a simple and usable SQL interactor, meant to be an example of how
libodbc++ can be used.

Everything must be terminated with a ';' before it is sent to the datasource.
To send statements containing several ';' (for example a "create procedure"), 
enclose the whole thing in double quotes, like this:

SQL> "create procedure test(a in number)
  +> begin
  +> ...
  +> end;";


Several commands are recognized:

	* commit [whatever]
		Commits a transaction. 
	* rollback [whatever]
		Rolls back the current transaction.

	* set NAME VALUE
	* show NAME
	
		Set or show the value of variable NAME. For now, the following are
		supported:
		* autocommit (on/off)
		* catalog (string)
		* maxrows (0=unlimited, >0 = maximum number of rows to return for
		  a result set

	* describe IDENTIFIER

		Give a description of IDENTIFIER, where IDENTIFIER is datasource
		specific. For example, in Mysql it is databasename.tablename, in 
		Oracle it is schemaname.tablename@databasename and so on.
		
		Note: this doesn't work right yet - drivers are immature.

		This also tries to show primary/foreign key information
		if IDENTIFIER is a table. Procedures are recognized, but
		not yet fully described.

Have fun.
